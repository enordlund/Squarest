# Squarest
Exploring API development with Swift AWS Lambda Runtime, AWS DynamoDB, URLSession, and SwiftUI
## Description
Squarest is an iOS app with an AWS backend for computing squares and sums, with a history view that can be filtered by operation type and date.
### iOS App Technologies
- SwiftUI
- URLSession
### AWS Technologies
- Swift AWS Lambda Runtime
- DynamoDB
- API Gateway
## Configuration
If you'd like to try something like this project, I recommend following Fabian Fett's [comprehensive instructions](https://fabianfett.de/getting-started-with-swift-aws-lambda-runtime) for deploying Swift AWS Lambda functions. Once that's done, you'll need to configure a DynamoDB database and API Gateway to interact with the Lambda functions.

If you'd like to run the iOS app on your device to test this project, please reach out for the API key and root URL, required in the iOS project (marked by a warning).
